# CertifytheWeb-Scripts
A repository of a few Certify the Web scripts I've put together over the years.

## FilezillaFTPS-CertifytheWeb
> Status: :warning: Deprecated
>
> Prior to Filezilla's native Let's Encrypt support, this script could be used to automate the renewal of a Let's Encrypt certificate into a Filezilla server with FTPS.



## RemoteDesktopServices-CertifytheWeb
> Status: :warning: Deprecated
>
> Automating deployment of a Let's Encrypt certificate to RDS services. The preferred alternative now is to use the built in RDS deployment or [WebProfusion's script](https://github.com/webprofusion/certify-plugins/blob/development/src/DeploymentTasks/Core/Providers/Assets/RDPGatewayServices.ps1).
